# Audio Summarization in real time for podcast, speeches and audio books
# How to build a Web App to Transcribe and Summarize audio with Python

We are going to build a web app to transcribe and summarize an episode podcasts, speeches and audio books, which gives the transcipt and summary for the given audio content. 
The app will be built using Streamlit, while AssemblyAI API will permit us to transcribe and summarize the episode of our Podcast. First, this API converts the audio into text using automatic Speech recognition, and, then, generates a summary of the text.
